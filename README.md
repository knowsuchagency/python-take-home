# Healthvana take-home coding interview

This repo contains three coding exercises. You should spend about 30 minutes to complete all three. For all of the exercises python is preferred, but if you feel you are much stronger with ruby, php, or javascript you can complete the problems in the language you are most comfortable with. Nothing here is intended to be tricky or complex.

The first exercise aims to get an understand of how you approach designing
 from scratch. Try to create a solution that would fulfill the requirements elegantly.
 
The second exercise is an attempt to understand your use of a language's functionality. It shouldn't take long to complete. A test case is provided so you can check your work.

The third exercise looks to get an idea of your familiarity with testing. The code is provided to you along with the stubbed out test cases. Fill in the test cases so that they cover all the functionality as best you can.
